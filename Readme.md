The dataset is too large, and it was not wise to upload them so in case of needing the dataset feel free to email me. My

I've used SVM and I get a reasonable f1-score, my friend insists on doing a preprocessing in the documents, I believe it 
doesn't help us because we are using tf-idf and it lowers the weight of stopwords enough, removing them won't help us but 
I'll do it too and announce the result.
